# Http API auto tests

## Dependencies
To use this test you'll need 3 npm packages:

```
$ sudo npm install --save chai
$ sudo npm install --save chai-http
$ sudo npm install --g mocha
```

Then run the input file with mocha, **NOT** nodejs.


You'll also need to add user id and server url to the \_config.js file, and rename it to config.js


This is the library used for assertions - Chai js. Docs are quite good.
